# DofE-student-info-portal
A website/app information portal for secondary school students. Built for my Duke of Edinburgh award (Skills section).

# Student Info Portal

This project is my **Duke of Edinburgh Skills Section** activity.  
I’m building a website/app that helps secondary school students with:
- Daily quiz questions on chosen subjects  
- Automatically updated news feed for students  
- Homework helper tools  
- Note/picture/sound recognition experiments  

## Goals
- Learn web development and app design  
- Use APIs to automate data (news, quizzes, etc.)  
- Develop consistent UI design skills  

## Timeline
- Month 0: Setup + planning  
- Month 1–6: Feature building and learning  

## DofE Log
All weekly learning summaries and screenshots will be uploaded to a 'DofE-log' file.
